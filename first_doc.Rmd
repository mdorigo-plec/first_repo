This report documents my first attempt of using Git and Github to version control on RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and committing changes to GitHub. 

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col ="red", xlab="speed(mph)", ylab="distance (miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))

```
